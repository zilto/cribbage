# General notes
- Should consider the complexity of estimators and scoring methods since they will multiply each other eventually
- Have to distinguish between assured pay-off (4 cards), and hypothetical pay-off (4+1 cards)

# Round setup phase
During this phase, the agent has to discard a number of cards to maximize expected pay-off from its hand. Secondly, it should maximize the expected cribe pay-off (if it's own), or minimize it for others. From its own hand, it should consider the possible cut card
